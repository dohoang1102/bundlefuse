## BundleFuse:


### Goals:
* Recover learner data by merging all termoinal-nodes from learner data trees.
* Instant-previewing of OTML learner data by launching the correct JNLP with the merged bundles.
* Saving the merged (recovered) learner data back to the sail data service.
* Provide visualization pages to help understand the learners experience.
* Provide aggregated statistics about offerings. 

### Todo:
* Configure ActiveResource model properties from a configuration file
* Better Mocking of ActiveResources though config files (or yaml)

### Bonus Todo Items:
* speed things up with Rails 2 cache for AR.
* Restful api for timeline XML fragments
* Restful api for SVG graphs from dot files
* Restful api for merging to xml documents

### Setup:
* change uri's for ActiveResource models: 

### requirements:
* thoughtbot-shoulda  (can get from github simpler(?) alternative to rspec...)
* activeresource
* acts_as_tree



### Method:
* Nodes map remote resources (bundles and groups) into a local tree. The local describes only the relation of the bundles by caching meta-data about the bundles.
* All content is retrieved from an authoritative data service and DIY portal.
